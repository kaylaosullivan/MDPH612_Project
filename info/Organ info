Larynx:
<b>Function:</b> Located below the throat, the larynx is involved with breathing, sound production and protecting your trachea. The larynx also holds the vocal cords that change the pitch and volume of your voice.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Difficulty swallonwing<br>- Voice may be temporarily hoarse<br>- Voice may change tone"

Spinal Cord:
"<b>Function:</b> The spinal cord is a long tubelike structure that begins at the end of the brain stem and continues down to the bottom of the spine. The spinal cord is made of nerves that carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body. It is also allows for reflexes. <br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- <i>Lhermitte's sign (occurs within a few months)</i>: causes an electric shock sensation beginning in the neck and shoots down to the legs. This will usually resolve without treatment.<br>- <i>Late Myelopathy (occurs months or years later)</i>: weakness, loss of sensation, and sometimes the Brown-Séquard syndrome. These effects may be permanent. <br>- <i>Brown-Séquard syndrome</i>: one side of the spinal cord is damaged, resulting in weakness on one side of the body and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the other side."

Brain:
<b>Function:</b>  The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system. It controls most of the activities of the body by processing and coordinating the information it receives from different organs and sending instructions to the rest of the body.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- <i>Fluid accumulation and swelling in brain (occurs in a few days)</i>: causes headaches, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and confusion. Usually goes away with time. <br>- <i>After a few months</i>: possible memory loss, personality changes, and trouble concentrating.

Parotid Gland:
"<b>Function:</b> The parotid gland is a the largest salivary gland and is located on either side of the mouth in front of the ears. It secretes saliva into the mouth to facilitate chewing and swallowing. <br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- "<br>- Dry mouth <br>- Difficulty swallowing <br>- Oral discomfort <br>- Malnutrition (due to difficulty eating) <br>- Oral mucositis <br>- Changes in taste <br>- Increased oral infections"



Ear:
"<b>Function:</b> The ear enables hearing. Having ears placed on either side of the head allows us to localize where a sound is coming from. Also, the fluid in the ears is what allows us to balance ourselves. <br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Hearing loss<br>- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)<br>- Dizziness or vertigo<br>- Earwax blockage<br>- Fluid buildup"



Oral Cavity:
"<b>Function:</b> The oral cavity refers to the mouth. It includes the lips, the lining inside the cheeks, the front part of the tongue, the upper and lower gums, the floor and roof of the mouth, and the area behind the wisdom teeth.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Increased infections<br>- Change in taste<br>- Inflammed mucous membranes of the mouth<br>- Fibrosis (growth of scar tissues) in mucous membranes of the mouth<br>- Tooth decay and gum disease<br>- Dry mouth<br>- Malnutrition (due to difficulty eating)<br>- Dehydration (due to difficuly drinking)"



Optic Chiasm:
"<b>Function:</b> The optic chiasm is the part of the brain where the optic nerves cross in the shape of an X. It allows us to have binocular vision.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- <i>Binocular vision loss</i>: causes distortions in depth perception and visual distance measurement<br>- Loss of vision in part of the visual field"



Optic Nerve:
"<b>Function:</b> The optic nerve, transmits visual information like brightness, colour and contrast from the retina to the brain. It also sends the reflex signals that cause the pupils to get smaller when light is shone into the eye.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Swelling of the optic nerve<br>- Loss of vision in affected eye(s)<br>- Colours may appear washed out in affected eye(s)"





Eyes:
"<b>Function:</b> The eyes provide vision and the ability to receive and process visual detail. Each eye is made of a complex system that includes many parts like the pupil, iris, cornea, lens and retina. When light enters the eye, it is focused onto the retina and turned into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Dry eyes<br>- Blurry vision or vision loss<br>- Cataracts<br>- Eye bleeding<br>- Loss of eye lashes<br>- Glaucoma (high pressure in eye)"


Mandible:
"<b>Function:</b> The mandible (or jawbone) the largest and strongest bone in the face. It forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place. The mandible is also the only moveable bone in the skull, allowing us to move out mouth and chew.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Jaw stiffness<br>- <i>Osteoradionecrosis (bone death)</i>: prone to fractures and dental issues"




Nape (Neck): 
"<b>Function:</b> The nape is the back part of the neck.<br><br><b>Potential Side Effects:</b><br>- Skin redness"
